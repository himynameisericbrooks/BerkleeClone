# BerkleeClone

This is a project that I did to help solidify my front-end skills.
I started this project with only a screenshot of an old version of the Berklee College of Music's website that I found online.
I psuedo-coded the different elements, and began creating a shell of the project with HTML and then used CSS to try to replicate every detail as closely as I possibly could.
I could not find the exact image used in the background, so I found something as close to it as I could and did something similar with fonts.
Overall, I was very happy with how closely I was able to get to the original look.

If I revisit this project, I would like to pay more attention to what would be an <a> vs. a <p> in the menu so it would look and feel a little more like an actual live site when someone views it.
